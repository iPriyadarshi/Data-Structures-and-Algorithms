/**
 * Calculates the sum of elements on both main diagonal and secondary diagonal of a square matrix.
 * For elements that belong to both diagonals (when matrix size is odd), they are counted only once.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(nÂ²) where n is the length of matrix
 * Space Complexity: O(1) as only a constant amount of extra space is used
 *
 * @param mat input square matrix (n x n)
 * @return sum of all elements on both diagonals
